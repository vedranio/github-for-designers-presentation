# GitHub for designers

My presentation for introducing Git and GiHub basics to designers.
Initially presented to the SEEK design team on 19 July 2017

## Reference

this presentation is built using  [FormidableLabs' Spectacle, a ReactJS based Presentation Library](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle).

## Making changes and running

I created the presentation by downloading the [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate/)

To run the presentation:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
